We were not very surprised when the project PEPP-PT [Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing] publicly launched, since it had been announced that some relevant institutions were working on a solution during the #WeVsVirus results ceremony. While we understand that it was unforeseeable how much progress the hackathon teams would make towards a tracing solution in one weekend, we did assume that once it became clear how many highly qualified developers, data protection officers and other experts were involved, a common discourse would emerge.</description></item></channel></rss>
